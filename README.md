# ProcessSimulator

Clone or copy the project.
(IDE like Eclipse or Intellij are recommended to finish this homework)
Go through the classes.

Finish the class PriorityQueue.java, ***you must not modify any other classes***.

Check the comments In PriorityQueue.java before you starts to code.
(Note that there is a method called `getSignature()`, you should replace the return value with your name.)

In Scheduler.java, there is a main class, which is the entrance of this repo.
After finishing PriorityQueue.java, you should be able to run this as java application.
The program will print out the processes execution trace.

# What to submit

The runnable jar of this java program.

For example, in eclipse, once you could run this program properly to print the trace, you could easily export a runnable file.
Without using IDE, things are a little complex.

Name your jar file as "netid".jar, e.g., My jar file will be gliu5.jar
Test out your runnable jar file bying using command `java -jar netid.jar`

And check the prints.
(1) The last print line should contain your name.
(2) In the print trace, you will see the process with higher priorities should be exectued first. Highly priority number means higher process priority.

upload your jar file into your home folder and create a symboliclink link file named as "netid".jar as well under /home/gliu5/homework/hw3
